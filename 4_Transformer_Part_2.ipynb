Encoder 부분은 이미 구현되어 있으므로 별도의 구현이 필요하지 않습니다. 지난주에 구현한 **2-4 Encoder Layer**에 이어, 이번 주에는 **2-5 Decoder Layer**부터 구현하시면 됩니다."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ka6H2paBcm85"},"source":["![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paul-hyun/paul-hyun.github.io/master/assets/2019-12-19/transformer-model-architecture.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Wm7BGAYLcy5d"},"source":["## Part 1. 준비"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lS-c6WnCc0Bn"},"source":["### 1-1.

RNN이 자연어 처리에서 유용했던 이유는 단어의 위치에 따라 단어를 순차적으로 입력받아서 처리하는 RNN의 특성으로 인해 각 단어의 위치 정보(position information)를 가질 수 있다는 점에 있었습니다.\n","\n","하지만 Transformer는 단어 입력을 순차적으로 받는 방식이 아니므로 단어의 위치 정보를 다른 방식으로 알려줄 필요가 있습니다. Transformer는 단어의 위치 정보를 얻기 위해서 각 단어의 임베딩 벡터에 위치 정보들을 더하여 모델의 입력으로 사용하는데, 이를 **포지셔널 인코딩(positional encoding)**이라고 합니다.\n","\n","Positional Encoding은 입력 문장 단어(토큰)들에 대한 위치정보를 인코딩하는 기술로, Transformer 모델의 입력 임베딩에 이 정보를 추가함으로써 단어의 상대적인 위치를 반영할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 함으로써 모델은 문장의 구조와 순서를 학습할 수 있게 됩니다.\n","\n","다음 코드는 Transformer에서 사용되는 대표적인 Positional Encoding 방법 중 하나인 Sinusodial Positional Encoding입니다. 이 방법은 고정된 함수로서 주기적인 값을 부여하여 위치정보를 인코딩합니다.\n","\n","Sinusodial Positional Encoding은 다음과 같은 수식을 사용하여 위치 인코딩 값을 계산합니다.\n","\n","$PE_{(pos,2i)}​ =sin(\\frac {pos}{10000^ {2i/d} model​}​ )$\n","\n","$PE_{(pos,2i+1)}​ =cos(\\frac {pos}{10000^ {2i/d} model​}​ )$\n","\n","여기서 $PE_{(pos, 2i)}$와 $PE_{(pos, 2i+1)}$는 Positional Encoding 행렬에서 $(pos, 2i)$와 $(pos, 2i+1)$ 위치에 해당하는 값을 의미하며, $pos$는 단어의 위치(position)를 나타내고, $i$는 인코딩 차원의 인덱스를 의미합니다. $d_{\\text{model}}$은 임베딩 차원의 크기를 나타냅니다.\n","\n","![](https://wikidocs.net/images/page/31379/transformer7.PNG)\n","\n","$pos$는 입력 문장에서의 임베딩 벡터의 위치를 나타내며, $i$는 임베딩 벡터 내의 차원의 인덱스를 의미합니다. 위의 식에 따르면 임베딩 벡터 내의 각 차원의 인덱스가 짝수인 경우에는 사인 함수의 값을 사용하고 홀수인 경우에는 코사인 함수의 값을 사용합니다. 위의 수식에서 $(pos, 2i)$일 때는 사인 함수를 사용하고,  $(pos, 2i+1)$ 일 때는 코사인 함수를 사용하고 있음을 주목합시다.\n","\n","\n","이렇게 구해진 Positional Encoding 행렬은 입력 임베딩과 더해져서 최종 입력으로 들어가게 되며, 모델은 이를 활용하여 문장의 구조와 순서를 이해하고 학습합니다.\n","\n","\n","![](https://wikidocs.net/images/page/31379/transformer5_final_final.PNG)\n","\n","위의 그림은 입력으로 사용되는 임베딩 벡터들이 트랜스포머의 입력으로 사용되기 전에 포지셔널 인코딩의 값이 더해지는 것을 보여줍니다. 임베딩 벡터가 인코더의 입력으로 사용되기 전 포지셔널 인코딩값이 더해지는 과정을 시각화하면 아래와 같습니다.\n","\n","![](https://wikidocs.net/images/page/31379/transformer6_final.PNG)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"e1sNGC1l0ye5"},"outputs":[],"source":["class TokenEmbedding(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim):\n","        super(TokenEmbedding, self).__init__()\n","        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n","\n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        embeddings = self.embedding(x)\n","        embeddings = embeddings.to(x.device)\n","\n","        return embeddings"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DubXWXYZ0y8F"},"outputs":[],"source":["class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, max_length, embedding_dim):\n","        super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()\n","        self.positional_encoding = self.create_positional_encoding(max_length, embedding_dim)\n","\n","    def get_angles(self, max_length, embedding_dim):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Calculates the angle values for positional encoding in a transformer model.\n","\n","        This function computes the sinusoidal positional encoding angles based on the specified maximum sequence length and the dimensionality of the embeddings.\n","        The positional encodings are used to add some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence.\n","        The formula used here ensures that each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid of different frequencies and phases.\n","\n","        Parameters:\n","        max_length (int): The maximum length of the input sequences for which the positional encodings are to be generated.\n","        embedding_dim (int): The dimensionality of the embeddings.

BLEU Score: 기계 번역의 성능 평가 도구(evaluation metric)\n","\n","#### **개요**\n","![](https://github.com/hyunwoongko/transformer/raw/master/image/transformer-model-size.jpg)\n","\n","BLEU(Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) Score는 기계 번역의 정확성을 평가하는 데 널리 사용되는 지표입니다. 2002년에 Kishore Papineni와 그의 동료들에 의해 개발되었습니다. 이 점수는 기계 번역 결과와 하나 이상의 참조 번역 사이의 유사성을 측정함으로써 번역의 품질을 수치적으로 평가합니다.\n","\n","#### **계산 방법**\n","BLEU 점수는 기계 번역된 텍스트와 사람이 번역한 참조 텍스트 사이의 단어 및 구(phrase)의 일치도를 측정합니다. 주요 계산 요소는 다음과 같습니다:\n","\n","1. **n-gram 일치**: BLEU 점수는 1-gram에서 4-gram까지의 n-gram 일치를 측정합니다. n-gram은 연속된 n개의 단어로 구성된 문자열입니다. 기계 번역의 n-gram이 참조 번역에 얼마나 자주 등장하는지를 분석하여 일치율을 계산합니다.\n","\n","2. **정밀도(precision)의 조정**: 단순한 정밀도 측정은 기계 번역에서 반복되는 구문을 과대평가할 수 있습니다. BLEU는 수정된 정밀도(modified precision)를 사용하여 이를 조정합니다. 각 n-gram의 빈도는 참조 번역에서의 최대 빈도에 맞춰 제한됩니다.\n","\n","3. **문장 길이의 조정**: 번역된 문장이 너무 짧을 경우, BLEU 점수는 브레버리 페널티(brevity penalty)를 적용하여 점수를 감소시킵니다. 이는 번역의 완성도를 보장하기 위해 설계되었습니다.\n","\n","#### **사용 및 한계**\n","BLEU 점수는 대규모 평가에서 빠르고 일관된 평가를 제공합니다. 그러나 모든 언어적 미묘함이나 문맥을 완전히 포착하지는 못한다는 비판도 있습니다. 예를 들어, 문법적으로 올바르거나 의미상 적합한 번역이 낮은 BLEU 점수를 받을 수 있습니다.\n","\n","#### **결론**\n","기계 번역 품질을 평가하는 도구로서, BLEU 점수는 여전히 중요한 역할을 합니다. 그러나 최적의 평가를 위해 다른 메트릭스와 함께 사용되어야 합니다. BLEU는 번역의 높은 정확도와 유창성을 보장하기 위한 초기 단계의 평가 도구로서 활용될 수 있습니다.\n","\n","BLEU score에 대해 더 자세히 알고 싶으시면 아래 링크에 있는 자료를 봐주세요:\n","\n","https://wikidocs.net/31695"],"metadata":{"id":"8akPDfCqdnh3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Transformer를 통해 번역된 문장을 실제로 출력하고, BLEU score도 계산하는 코드입니다. 그대로 사용해주세요."],"metadata":{"id":"RjG3fLTIeqFh"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu\n","\n","def get_text(sequence, language):\n","    # Truncate sequence before <eos>\n","    eos_index = (sequence == eos_idx).nonzero(as_tuple=True)\n","    if eos_index[0].numel() > 0:\n","        sequence = sequence[:eos_index[0][0].item()]\n","    return ' '.join([vocab[language].get_itos()[idx] for idx in sequence])\n","\n","def print_translation_and_calculate_bleu_score(src_sequence: Tensor, tgt_sequence: Tensor, output_sequence: Tensor):\n","    output_sequence = output_sequence.max(dim=-1)[1]\n","    sequences = {'Source': (src_sequence[1:], src_language), 'Target': (tgt_sequence[1:], tgt_language), 'Output': (output_sequence, tgt_language)}\n","\n","    reference = []\n","    for domain, (sequence, language) in sequences.items():\n","        text = get_text(sequence, language)\n","        print(f\"{domain}: {text}\")\n","\n","        if domain != 'Source':\n","            words = text.split()\n","            if domain == 'Target':\n","                reference.append(words)\n","            else:  # Output\n","                score = sentence_bleu(reference, words, weights=(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25))\n","\n","    print(\"\\n\")\n","\n","    return score"],"metadata":{"id":"4qUircLHnG2T"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["아래 코드를 실행하면 다음과 같은 구조의 출력을 보게 됩니다:\n","\n","```\n","Source:\n","Target:\n","Output:\n","```\n","여기서 source는 우리가 번역하고자 하는 문장(독일어), target은 우리가 원하는 번역된 문장(영어), output은 Transformer 모델이 생성한 문장(영어) 입니다.\n","각각의 data sample에 대해 위와 같은 결과가 출력되고 맨 아래에 계산된 BLUE score를 보실 수 있습니다.\n","\n"," **0.2 넘기셔야 됩니다!**"],"metadata":{"id":"ltYpaMGyez2H"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_dataloader = custom_dataloader.make_dataloader(test_data, batch_size)\n","test(test_dataloader, transformer, criterion)"],"metadata":{"id":"jrRdOFiukpJD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723462537759,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":98788,"user":{"displayName":"김민준","userId":"00376366833054431661"}},"outputId":"25497ede-915d-4fe9-c865-16bc760587ea"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:558: UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 4 worker processes in total.
